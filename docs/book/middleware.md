# HTTP Middleware

For every bus system a middleware exists and one Middleware to rule them all. If you use JSON or XML in the request body
for your message data, you have to convert this data to an array before you can call the middleware.

> Note: The middleware uses an array for the message data

## CommandMiddleware

The `CommandMiddleware` dispatches the message data to the command bus system. This middleware needs an request attribute
(`$request->getAttribute(\Prooph\HttpMiddleware\CommandMiddleware::NAME_ATTRIBUTE)`) called `prooph_command_name`.
This name is used for the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\MessageFactory` to create the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\Message` object. The data for the command is extracted from the body of the request (`$request->getParsedBody()`) and must be an array.

## QueryMiddleware

The `QueryMiddleware` is used to dispatch messages to the query bus system. Unlike the other middleware, the `QueryMiddleware` supports sending multiple messages. Each query is an object inside of the root `queries` object on the request payload and is indexed using a unique key. The response will include the query results for each query, indexed using the same key as the request. An example request/response would look like:

### Request

`POST /query`

```json
{
    "queries": {
        "getUsers": {
            "prooph_query_name": "query:get-users",
            "filter": [
                "12"
            ]
        },
        "getTodos": {
            "prooph_query_name": "query:get-todos",
            "status": [
                "OPEN"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Response

```json
{
    "getUsers": [
        {
            "username": "John"
        }
    ],
    "getTodos": [
        {
            "task": "Write some docs"
        },
        {
            "task": "Build cool things"
        }
    ]
}
```

## EventMiddleware

The `EventMiddleware` dispatches the message data to the event bus system. This middleware needs an request attribute
(`$request->getAttribute(\Prooph\HttpMiddleware\EventMiddleware::NAME_ATTRIBUTE)`) called `prooph_event_name`. This name is used for the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\MessageFactory` to create the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\Message` object. The data for the event is extracted from the body of the request (`$request->getParsedBody()`) and must be an array.

*Note:*

The `EventMiddleware` is commonly used for external event messages. An event comes from your domain, which was caused by a command. It makes no sense to use this middleware in your project, if you only use a command bus with event sourcing.
In  this case you will use the [event store bus bridge)](https://github.com/prooph/event-store-bus-bridge "Marry CQRS with Event Sourcing").

## MessageMiddleware

The `MessageMiddleware` dispatches the message data to the suitable bus system depending on message type. The data
for the message is extracted from the body of the request (`$request->getParsedBody()`) and must be an array. The
`message_name` is extracted from the parsed body data. This name is used for the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\MessageFactory` to create the `\Prooph\Common\Messaging\Message` object. Your specific message data must be located under the `payload` key. The value of `$request->getParsedBody()` is an array like this:

```php
[
    'message_name' => 'command:register-user',
    'payload' => [
        'name' => 'prooph'
    ],
    'metadata' => []
    // other keys like uuid
]
```

**Important:** The provided message factory must handle all 3 types (command, query, event) of messages depending on provided message name. It's recommended to use an prefix or something else in the message name to determine the correct message type.
